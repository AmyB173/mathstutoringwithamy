## UX Design

### Strategy - User stories

- as a user I want to know what type of Maths is being offered
- as a user I want to know the type of service being offered
- as a user I want to know what the price of the services
- as a user I want to see an example of the teaching
- as a user I want to see to be able to make contact 
- as a user I want to see reviews of the business 
- as a user I want genuine help for my child, not hard sell

### Strategy - Business Goals 

- as a business I want to inspire confidence
- as a business I want to offer a genuine and real experience, no fake promises.
- as a business I want to attract tutoring clients and encourage contact

### Strategy - User Stories

#### First-time visitor (novice or experienced)
 

#### Novice guitar owner (first-time visit)


#### Experienced guitar owner (first-time visit)




#### Returning Visitor (second+ repair)

### Strategy - Importance vs Viability 

| Opportunity/Problem | Importance | Viability
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- 
| To provide information about the core purpose of the business | 5 | 5 |
| To provide cost information | 5 | 5
| To showcase the owner's guitar playing ability | 2 | 5 |
| To increase following to owner's band | 2 | 5
| To showcase the types of repairs completed by the business | 4 | 5
| To highlight good reviews of the business | 5 | 5
| To provide contact details of the business | 5 | 5
| To provide information about the owner's work history as a race car mechanic | 3 | 5
| Totals | 31 | 40

As these totals are quite different, this has highlighted that not all of these should be implemented. 

| Opportunity/Problem | Importance | Viability
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- 
| To provide information about the core purpose of the business | 5 | 5 |
| To provide cost information | 5 | 5
| To showcase the types of repairs completed by the business | 4 | 5
| To highlight good reviews of the business | 5 | 5
| To provide contact details of the business | 5 | 5
| Totals | 24 | 25

By removing three of the opportunities the totals come closer and it has created a more manageable set of goals.

## Tools and Technologies Used
 - Custom HTML and CSS were used throughout.
 - [Bootstrap v5.1.3](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/getting-started/introduction/) was used in this project at various points for layout, form styling, creating cards and the navbar. I made some adaptations to the bootstrap styling at various points too. 
 - CSS Flexbox was also used for layout purposes (outside of Bootstrap) - the reason I used Flexbox without Bootstrap was that it felt lighter and more customisable in places in addition to giving me good practice of using both flexbox and bootstrap for layout. 
 - Git for version control
 - Github for saving and storing files
 - VS Code for locally coding my project (to replace the use of online IDE such as Gitpod or Codeanywhere)
 - [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) for the font used in the website
 - Google developer tools to test the website for responsiveness and to fix bugs.
 - [Picture to people](https://www.picturetopeople.org/text_generator/others/transparent/transparent-text-generator.html "Picture to People website") was used to generate the title with a transparent background that overlays the hero image. 
 - [Image Resizer](https://imageresizer.com "Image Resizer Website") was used to compress and resize images. 
 - [Convertio](https://convertio.co/) for turning jpg to webp
 - [Coolors](https://coolors.co/ "Coolors Website") was used to generate the colour palette. 
 - Google Maps API to embed a map using an iframe.
 - [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) was used for all icons used on my page.
 - [Am I Responsive?](https://www.google.com/search?q=am+i+responsive&rlz=1C1ONGR_en-GBGB985GB985&oq=am+i+respon&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUqBggAEEUYOzIGCAAQRRg7MgYIARBFGDkyBggCEEUYQDIGCAMQRRhBMgYIBBBFGDwyBggFEEUYPNIBCDE4NTRqMGo3qAIAsAIA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) to show how the website looks on different size screens and devices.
 - WAVE chrome extension for accessibility testing
 - WCAG Contrast checker chrome extension for colour contrast checking
- [W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) for validating HTML and CSS
