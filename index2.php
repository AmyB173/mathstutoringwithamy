                <p class="lead mb-4">From my 11 years in the classroom, Iâ€™ve come to realise that the most important
                  factor for a childâ€™s success is how much they enjoy the lessons, and how connected they feel to their
                  teacher/tutor. </p>

                <p>As educators, we should be making sure that each and every lesson builds excitement for the subject
                  and celebrates the progress the child makes in each lesson. </p>
                <strong class="">The result for your family?</strong> A child who feels seen and heard, who has regained
                some of their confidence and who is excited to put their minds to work so they can really make the most
                progress possible.
