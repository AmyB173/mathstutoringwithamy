                    <h2>Welcome!</h2>
                    <p>I'm so glad you've decided to opt for some tutoring for your child, whether it's to <strong>boost their confidence, improve grades, or prepare for exams</strong>. I am a qualified secondary school Mathematics Teacher with <strong>11 years of experience</strong> teaching KS3, KS4 and A Level Maths in both private and state secondary schools. My lessons are designed to be welcoming, stress-free, and focused on building confidence and improving grades in a positive and sustainable way.</p>
                    <hr class="my-5">

                    <h2>Lesson Details & Platform</h2>
                    <p>All lessons take place <strong>online for convenience and flexibility</strong>, allowing students to join from home. We use an interactive platform called <strong>Pencil Spaces</strong> (pencilspaces.com), which features video calls and a shared whiteboard. Students will need to create a free account to collaborate in real-time and receive instant feedback and support.</p>
                    <hr class="my-5">

                    <h2>Small Group Lessons</h2>
                    <p>I only take on small groups, with a <strong>maximum of 5 students</strong>, who are grouped with others working at a similar grade level. The atmosphere is fantastic, as students often encourage and learn from each other. Each student gets their own <strong>private whiteboard</strong>, ensuring they receive individual attention and personalised feedback while enjoying a relaxed group environment. Homework is set each week and is completed and marked on the platform.</p>
                    <hr class="my-5">

                    <h2>1:1 Lessons</h2>
                    <p>One-on-one lessons foster a <strong>strong tutor-student relationship</strong>, creating a supportive environment where your child feels comfortable asking questions and tackling challenges with confidence. Sessions include <strong>tailored lesson plans</strong> designed around your child's specific needs and a patient, encouraging atmosphere for learning at their own pace. While highly effective, some students find these lessons intense, which is why small group lessons are also available.</p>

                    <h2>Requirements for Tutoring</h2>
                     <p>To get started, please complete the student information form. Students need a <strong>laptop with a camera</strong>, and cameras should generally be kept on to help build a positive relationship. If there's a reason the camera must be off, like anxiety, I can accommodate this. A pen, paper, and calculator are needed, and for ongoing tutoring, a <strong>drawing pad (~£30) or a tablet with a pen is required</strong> for easier on-screen interaction.</p>

                        <p><strong>Initial Lessons:</strong> To ensure the right fit, the first few lessons can be booked <strong>individually on a trial basis.</strong>
                        <br><strong>Ongoing Lessons:</strong> If your child is happy, I will book them into a weekly ongoing spot. Lessons are <strong>invoiced on the 1st of each month</strong> for all lessons in the upcoming month.
                        <br><strong>Cancellation:</strong> For 1:1 lessons, <strong>48 hours' notice is required</strong>. I will try to reschedule or roll over the credit to the next month. Small group lessons cannot be cancelled, but a recording will be made available for catch-up and the homework will still be set and marked.
                        <br><strong>Guarantee:</strong> I only want to tutor students who love their sessions. If you choose to cancel, any <strong>unused lessons will be refunded, no questions asked.</strong></p>
